**Pitch Clustering**



Being able to identify pitches is key to any baseball team as it would allow for teams to prepare for what each pitch looks like. Each batter would be able to prepare in the batting cage or in batting practice based off the opposing pitcher's repertoire. This would also allow for teams to identify trends within a pitcher's game plan and approach to getting hitters out. Hitters could almost begin to expect what pitch is coming in certain counts from clustering pitches.



The following project was done in the R language using the K Nearest Neighbors model (KNN.) KNN creates a number of clusters or grouping based on the number of attributes and data points within the data set. As you read through the code you'll see how well the model ran throughout the data and generate the proper amount of clusters. 



A KNN assignment is rather simple and easy to complete. It is usually the best way to open up any data science project. It allows any data scientist to understand the data.



Below shows the groupings of all the pitches within the model created.
