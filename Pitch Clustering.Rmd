## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readr)
library(class)
library(dplyr)
library(cluster)
```

# Import Data Set

```{r}
candex_pitch_data <- read_csv("~/candex_pitch_data.csv")
Twins_pitches <- candex_pitch_data
rm(candex_pitch_data)
```

# Check for NA's

# removal of NA's is a key component as the model will not run with NA values

```{r}
sum(is.na(Twins_pitches))
Twins_pitches <- na.omit(Twins_pitches)
```

# Checking Summary

```{r}
summary(Twins_pitches[10:14])
```

# Creating Box Plots for Above Attributes

```{r}
boxplot(Twins_pitches[10:14])
```

# Converting Columns to Numeric

```{r}
Twins_pitches[28:30] <- lapply(Twins_pitches[28:30], as.numeric)
```

# Cleaning data

# The data was pretty clean itself as I did not need to do much per se. I removed all of the extremeties from the data set in basied off of the ReleaseSpeed and HorzBreak attributes. Instead of removing three full columns I decided to convert all NA's to 0 value. Which will help me for question 2

```{r}
Twins_pitches[is.na(Twins_pitches)] <- 0
Twins_pitches <- filter(Twins_pitches, ReleaseSpeed < 106.00 & ReleaseSpeed > 70)
Twins_pitches <- filter(Twins_pitches, HorzBreak > -289.00 & HorzBreak < 289.00)
```

# Rerun Boxplots and Summary

```{r}
boxplot(Twins_pitches[10:14])
summary(Twins_pitches[10:14])

```

# Training The Data

# I split the data set into train and test groups to ensure a fair test

```{r}
set.seed(16153)
Twins_train <- sample(nrow(Twins_pitches), 0.75*nrow(Twins_pitches), replace = FALSE)
Twins_train_set <- Twins_pitches[Twins_train,]
Twins_test_set <- Twins_pitches[-Twins_train,]
```

# K Nearest Neighbors

# I used the K Nearest Neighbors model for this assignment. The K Neareast Neighbor model will allow me to cluster the data into groups based off of the pitching attributes within the data set.

```{r}
pclust <- kmeans(Twins_train_set[10:14], 5, 100)
```

# Append cluster column from KMeans to Twins_train_set

# I then added the cluster attribute from the results of the model to the train data set.

```{r}
Twins_train_set$cluster <- pclust$cluster
```

# Perform K Means on Test Set

```{r}
pclust_test <- kmeans(Twins_test_set[10:14], 5, 100)
```

# Append cluster column from KMeans to Twins_test_set

# I then added the cluster attribute from the results of the model to the test data set.

```{r}
Twins_test_set$cluster <- pclust_test$cluster
```

# Creating Pitch Type column

# After viewing the components the model used to determine the clusters I used my baseball knowledge and some research on Baseball Savant to determine what pitches best resembled each cluster. I then created a separate column to show what pitch represents each cluster.

```{r}
Twins_train_set <- mutate(Twins_train_set, "PitchType" = case_when(Twins_train_set$cluster == 5 ~ "FB"))
Twins_train_set$PitchType[Twins_train_set$cluster == 1] <- "LH SL"
Twins_train_set$PitchType[Twins_train_set$cluster == 2] <- "LH CV"
Twins_train_set$PitchType[Twins_train_set$cluster == 3] <- "RH SL"
Twins_train_set$PitchType[Twins_train_set$cluster == 4] <- "RH CV"
```

```{r}
Twins_test_set <- mutate(Twins_test_set, "PitchType" = case_when(Twins_test_set$cluster == 5 ~ "RH CV"))
Twins_test_set$PitchType[Twins_test_set$cluster == 1] <- "FB"
Twins_test_set$PitchType[Twins_test_set$cluster == 2] <- "LH SL"
Twins_test_set$PitchType[Twins_test_set$cluster == 3] <- "RH SL"
Twins_test_set$PitchType[Twins_test_set$cluster == 4] <- "LH CV"
```


# Create Graph

# Based off this graph you can see how the model ran. In the data set most pitches were around a general area which gives the reason as to why most of them are centralized in one area. I was unable to graph every data point as it mad ethe graph look messy and compact. I decided to graph every 400th row in the train data set as I beleived it would still give an accurate representation of the model.
```{r}
Twins_train_new = Twins_train_set[seq(1, nrow(Twins_train_set), 400), ]

clusplot(Twins_train_new, Twins_train_new$cluster, color = T, lwd = 2, main = "KNN Pitches")
```
